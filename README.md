# Airbnb-Listings

In this project, I aim to explore and analyze the 2016-17 Airbnb datasets for Seattle and Boston to gain insights into key trends and factors influencing these two cities' rental markets. My objectives include:

1. **Identifying Key Amenities:** Determine the most important amenities that are commonly offered in Airbnb listings in each city, and compare how they differ between Seattle and Boston.

2. **Price Prediction with Key Features:** Investigate whether it's possible to predict the price of Airbnb listings using just five features. If successful, I will analyze and compare the accuracy of these predictions for each city.

3. **Monthly Price Trends:** Examine how listing prices vary across different months and assess any seasonal trends in Seattle and Boston. The analysis will highlight how prices change in each city over time.

4. **Trends in Listing Numbers:** Track the total number of listings each month to observe fluctuations and compare trends in both Seattle and Boston, identifying periods of growth or decline in each market.

By addressing these questions, this project seeks to provide a comprehensive comparison of the Airbnb markets in Seattle and Boston. The datasets used for this analysis can be accessed here:
